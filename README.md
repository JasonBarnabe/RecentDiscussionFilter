RecentDiscussionFilter is a [Vanilla Forums](https://vanillaforums.com) plugin that adds a toggle to the Recent Discussions list to filter certain discussions. This is useful for example if you have a certain type of discussion that crowds out the rest on the Recent Discussions list; with this plugin, users have the option to filter those discussions.

## Installation

1. Add the files under `(vanillahome)/plugins/RecentDiscussionFilter`
2. Copy `config-default.php` to `config.php`.
3. Customize `config.php` (see comments in that file).
4. Enable the plugin.
